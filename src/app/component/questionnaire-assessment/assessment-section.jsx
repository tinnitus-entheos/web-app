                The purpose of this task is to find a loudness level at which
                the beeping sound/speech is most comfortable to listen to.
                Choose this level by presuming that you must listen to the
                beeping sound/speech to obtain information from it. For example,
                if you listen to the news on the radio would you adjust the
                volume to that level.
