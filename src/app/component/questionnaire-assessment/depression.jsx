          The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) is a screening tool designed to
          identify symptoms of depression in older adults. It consists of simple
          yes/no questions that assess emotional well-being, energy levels, and
          social engagement. Scoring provides a measure of depressive symptoms,
          helping clinicians determine the need for further evaluation or
          intervention tailored to the elderly population.

          The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is a widely used screening
          tool for diagnosing and measuring the severity of depression. It
          assesses the frequency of depressive symptoms over the past two weeks,
          including mood, sleep, appetite, and concentration. Scoring allows
          healthcare providers to evaluate the level of depression and plan
          appropriate treatment or referrals.

          The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is a self-report questionnaire
          used to measure the intensity of depressive symptoms. It evaluates

          sadness, self-criticism, and energy levels. Scoring provides a
          quantitative assessment of depression severity, guiding clinicians in
