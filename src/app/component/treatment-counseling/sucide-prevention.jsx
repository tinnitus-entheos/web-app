          Treating hearing loss is crucial in managing chronic tinnitus, as the
          two conditions are often closely linked. Hearing loss can exacerbate
          the perception of tinnitus by reducing the auditory input that
          typically masks tinnitus sounds. Addressing hearing loss through
          hearing aids or other auditory interventions can help restore this
          input, making tinnitus less prominent and more manageable.
          Additionally, improving hearing can enhance communication and social
          interaction, reducing the stress and isolation that often accompany
          tinnitus. By treating hearing loss, patients can experience a more
          comprehensive and effective approach to managing their tinnitus,
          leading to better overall outcomes and quality of life.
